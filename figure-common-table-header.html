<p>Suggested use of table below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find the row that corresponds to your current/previous major
  by looking in the first column of the table below.</li>
<li>Look for the column that corresponds to how many years
  you have completed in your current/previous major.</li>
<li>Inside that box the other SICCS majors are ranked by
  the number of required classes that you have already completed.</li>
<li>Click the new major to see its requirements in the course catalog.</li>
<li>Click the number of classes in common to see a figure which
  compares the pre-requisite graphs for those two majors.</li>
<li>Each node in the graph represents a required class listed under
  the "Details" tab on the web page for that major in the NAU course
  catalog.</li>
<li>Colored nodes are common to the two majors, and white nodes do not
  appear on the other major shown in that figure.</li>
<li>Each edge points from a required course to course that requires
  it.</li>
</ul>
