<title>NAU SICCS Programs</title>
<p>This web page shows how much overlap there is between
classes which are required by each SICCS undergraduate major.
It is meant to help students find out how much work it would
be to switch majors. Suggested use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find the row that corresponds to your current/previous major
  by looking in the first column of the table below.</li>
<li>Look for the column that corresponds to how many years
  you have completed in your current/previous major.</li>
<li>Inside that box the other SICCS majors are ranked by
  the number of required classes that you have already completed.</li>
<li>Click the new major to see its requirements in the course catalog.</li>
<li>Click the number of classes in common to see a figure which
  compares the pre-requisite graphs for those two majors.</li>
<li>Each node in the graph represents a required class listed under
  the "Details" tab on the web page for that major in the NAU course
  catalog.</li>
<li>Colored nodes are common to the two majors, and white nodes do not
  appear on the other major shown in that figure.</li>
</ul>
